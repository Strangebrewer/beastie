NEXT: Figure out how to make an upload SVG icon button trigger a click on a hidden input (it uses $refs in Vue).

Add ability to upload svgs to the images page and save them to the DB for re-use (like images)

Fix radial gradients in triangles so they're actually centered (triangle centroid)

See if you can use clip-path to make image backgrounds for objects. What I'm thinking is you'd have an object and you put an image behind it, sized to fit, and you make the object's fill transparent, and you group them together.



If this ever becomes public (or you make it your portfolio), make sure you limit the number of images any single account can have uploaded at a time. Don't want to fuck your Cloudinary account.
